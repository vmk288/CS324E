Vaishnavi Kashyap - For this assignment, I worked on the unique visualization (part 2). I chose the dataset "Census Populations in 2010 by zipcode." The 3 variables present in my graph are total population, median age of people in the household, and average household size. It's interesting to see the relationship between the 3 variables; The higher the population and median age of people in the household, the bigger the average household size seems to be. The interactivity I implemented in the graph was zooming in and out and being able to rotate the graph around the data.
