Vaishnavi Kashyap - I was initially going to use my train from Assignment 1, but that was a bit too complicated, so I decided to use a very simple train and have two cars going the same way on a road. I created class Train and created a flashing light as a subclass in my display method. The trains are going two different speeds and a new train object is created every time they reach the end of the canvas. I ran into some trouble with the dimensions because I was first using rectMode(CENTER) but reverting back to rectMode(CORNER) fixed this.
