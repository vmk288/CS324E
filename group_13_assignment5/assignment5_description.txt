The intended animation shows Earth, Mars, and their moons. It shows what would happen to all the houses on Earth if we ever lost control of gravity and space ships showing galactic exploration searching for an explanation to solve the issue. Hopefully, we will have adapted to living in such conditions by that time.

Vaishnavi Kashyap - I was initially going to make 2 3D houses with opening/closing doors and a rotating window, but ended up making 6 smaller 3D houses. The main class is each house itself being translated around a center point and the subclass is each house additionally flipping on its own axis. I also adding flashing lights to the background and a bit of transparency to the houses so that the 3D part is easier to see. 

Danish Tharvani - I created two 3D Spaceship Objects that fly across the canvas at "lightening speed". The spaceships have a 3D tail behind that that shrinks and lengthens to mimic the back engine of a rocket. As the spaceships each reach the end of the canvas, they return to their original position, at the bottom of the canvas, and translate up again. Each spaceship is of different size and translate at different speeds.

Aimilee Tran - The original plan was to make trees with oranges falling from the trees to serve as an animation while the tree itself rotates. However, I had a lot of trouble with creating a cylinder for the tree trunk despite even searching the internet for a solution. Instead, I've opted to make planet Earth in the center and Mars at the side. For the subclass of each planet, I created a moon. All the planets and moons rotate at different speeds. Mars is adjacent to Earth which is visible as everything rotates and orbits each other.
