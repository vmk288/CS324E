Open the file group_12_assignment7.pde in Processing.
Run the program to begin the game.
Use the left and right arrow keys to change the angle of the bubble shooter.
Press the space bar to shoot a bubble.
Press the key 'z' to toggle the guide to make the game easier.
Press the key 'x' to pause or unpause.
The next bubble colors are at the bottom of the screen, as is the score.
Match three or more bubbles of the same color to pop them.
Score increases more for popping more bubbles in one shot.
Also, the score increases even more for popping bubbles in a way such that some are detached from the rest and fall.
If the bubbles reach the bottom of the grid, you lose the game.
If you pop all of the bubbles (including the ones which you add), then you win the game.
From the pause menu, use the mouse and click an option.
The options on the pause menu are resume, which unpauses, reset, which resets the game, and exit, which quits the game.
From the win or lose screens, press any key to play again.
