In this project, I implemented 4 different filters and used keyPressed() to allow for user input. 
Press 0 for Original Image
	  1 for Gray Scale
	  2 for Contrast
	  3 for Gaussian Blur
	  4 for Edge Detection/Sobel
I had some trouble with Edge Detection, the issue being the array was out of bounds, but that was fixed. The main functionality
for each filter was basically the same, with subtle differences in traversing through the kernel.
